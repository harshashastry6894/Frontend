Insertion sort:
	builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted

Implemenation:
	psuedo code:
		1. start picking the second element in the array
		2. compare second element with one before it and swap if necessary
		3. continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (left side)
           to place the element in the correct place
        4. Repeat untill the array is sorted

    code:
        const insertionSort = (arr) => {
        for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            let currentValue = arr[i];
            for (let j = i -1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentValue ; j--) {
                arr[j+1] =a[j]
            }
            a[j+1] = currentValue;
        }
        return arr;
        }

    console.log(insertionSort([8, -3, 12, 29, 45, 88, 97]));

time complexity
	best: O(n)
	worst naverage: O(n2)
